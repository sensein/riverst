                "text": "**Chapter 1: Marley’s Ghost**\n\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\ntights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail,\nand his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was\nclasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail;\nand it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys,\npadlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body\nwas transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his\nwaistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\nnever believed it until now.\n\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\nobserved before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his\nsenses.\n\n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What\ndo you want with me?”\n\n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“Ask me who I was.”\n\n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice.\n“You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say\n“to a shade,” but substituted this, as more\nappropriate.\n\n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”\n\n“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking\ndoubtfully at him.\n\n“Do it, then.”\n\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a ghost\nso transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and\nfelt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\n\n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.\n\n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.\n\n“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your\nsenses?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Why do you doubt your senses?”\n\n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them.\nA slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an\nundigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment\nof an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about\nyou, whatever you are!”\n\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in\nhis heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\nterror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very marrow in his\nbones.\n\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment,\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\nvery awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal\natmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\nhair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour\nfrom an oven.\n\n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to\nthe charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were\nonly for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.\n\n“I do,” replied the Ghost.\n\n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.\n\n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”\n\n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this,\nand be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of\nmy own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”\n\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\nhorror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\nbreast!\n\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you\ntrouble me?”\n\n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you\nbelieve in me or not?”\n\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk\nthe earth, and why do they come to me?”\n\n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that\nthe spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel\nfar and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned\nto do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh,\nwoe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared\non earth, and turned to happiness!”\n\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\nshadowy hands.\n\n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me\nwhy?”\n\n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost.\n“I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my\nown free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange\nto you?”\n\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n\n“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight\nand length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy\nand as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it,\nsince. It is a ponderous chain!”\n\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he\ncould see nothing.\n\n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell\nme more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\n\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes\nfrom other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other\nministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A\nvery little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I\ncannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark\nme!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our\nmoney-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”\n\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n\n“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge\nobserved, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n\n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.\n\n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all\nthe time!”\n\n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace.\nIncessant torture of remorse.”\n\n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.\n\n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.\n\n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven\nyears,” said Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom,\n“not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures,\nfor this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is\nsusceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit\nworking kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its\nmortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that\nno space of regret can make amends for one life’s opportunity\nmisused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”\n\n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,”\nfaltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n\n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again.\n“Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business;\ncharity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business.\nThe dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive\nocean of my business!”\n\nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of\nall its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said,\n“I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings\nwith my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star\nwhich led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to\nwhich its light would have conducted me!”\n\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”\n\n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be hard upon\nme! Don’t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!”\n\n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I\nmay not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”\n\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the\nperspiration from his brow.\n\n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost.\n“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and\nhope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”\n\n“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. “Thank’ee!”\n\n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three\nSpirits.”\n\nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had\ndone.\n\n“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he\ndemanded, in a faltering voice.\n\n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot\nhope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell\ntolls One.”\n\n“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over,\nJacob?” hinted Scrooge.\n\n“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third\nupon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to\nvibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you\nremember what has passed between us!”\n\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the\ntable, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the\nsmart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural\nvisitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over\nand about its arm.\n\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the\nwindow raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it\nwas wide open.\n\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two\npaces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him\nto come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\n\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of\nthe hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent\nsounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in\nthe mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\n\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked\nout.\n\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\nlike Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)\nwere linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost,\nin a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle,\nwho cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\ninfant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all\nwas, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters,\nand had lost the power for ever.",

                "text": "**Chapter 2: Ghosts of Departed Usurers**\n\nWhen Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that\nlooking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window\nfrom the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the\ndarkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church\nstruck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must\nhave got into the works. Twelve!\n\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\n\n“Why, it isn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I\ncan have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t\npossible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at\nnoon!”\n\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and\nextremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and\nfro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if\nnight had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This\nwas a great relief, because “three days after sight of this First\nof Exchange pay to Mr Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,” and so\nforth, would have become a mere United States’ security if there\nwere no days to count by.\n\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over\nand over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought,\nthe more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the\nmore he thought.\n\nMarley’s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved\nwithin himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind\nflew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position,\nand presented the same problem to be worked all through, “Was it a\ndream or not?”\n\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must\nhave sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it\nbroke upon his listening ear.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“A quarter past,” said Scrooge, counting.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“Half-past!” said Scrooge.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“A quarter to it,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Ding, dong!”\n\n“The hour itself,” said Scrooge, triumphantly, “and\nnothing else!”\n\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\ndull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up\nin the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\n\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the\ncurtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which\nhis face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and\nScrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face\nto face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am\nnow to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n\nIt was a strange figure—like a child: yet not so like a child as\nlike an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him\nthe appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to\na child’s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and\ndown its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a\nwrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were\nvery long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of\nuncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like\nthose upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and\nround its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was\nbeautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in\nsingular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with\nsummer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the\ncrown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all\nthis was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in\nits duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held\nunder its arm.\n\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,\nwas not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and\nglittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one\ninstant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in\nits distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now\nwith twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without\na body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the\ndense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it\nwould be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\n\n“Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?”\nasked Scrooge.\n\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of being so\nclose beside him, it were at a distance.\n\n“Who, and what are you?” Scrooge demanded.\n\n“I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.”\n\n“Long Past?” inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish\nstature.\n\n“No. Your past.”\n\nPerhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have\nasked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and\nbegged him to be covered.\n\n“What!” exclaimed the Ghost, “would you so soon put\nout, with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are\none of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole\ntrains of years to wear it low upon my brow!”\n\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge\nof having wilfully “bonneted” the Spirit at any period of\nhis life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\n\n“Your welfare!” said the Ghost.\n\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that\na night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The\nSpirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:\n\n“Your reclamation, then. Take heed!”\n\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the\narm.\n\n“Rise! and walk with me!”\n\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the\nhour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the\nthermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in\nhis slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon\nhim at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman’s hand, was\nnot to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards\nthe window, clasped his robe in supplication.\n\n“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to\nfall.”\n\n“Bear but a touch of my hand there,” said the Spirit,\nlaying it upon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than\nthis!”\n\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\nan open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\nvanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\nhad vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow\nupon the ground.\n\n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as\nhe looked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”\n\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\nlight and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s\nsense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the\nair, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys,\nand cares long, long, forgotten!\n\n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is\nthat upon your cheek?”\n\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a\npimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n\n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.\n\n“Remember it!” cried Scrooge with fervour; “I could\nwalk it blindfold.”\n\n“Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!” observed\nthe Ghost. “Let us go on.”\n\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,\nand tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\nbridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\ntrotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\nboys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\nin great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were\nso full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\n\n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said\nthe Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\n\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\nthem every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several\nhomes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A\nsolitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached\na mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted\ncupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but\none of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their\nwalls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates\ndecayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses\nand sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its\nancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing\nthrough the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,\ncold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness\nin the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up\nby candle-light, and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a\nsoftening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments:\nwonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with\nan axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with\nwood.\n\n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.\n“It’s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One\nChristmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he\ndid come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And\nValentine,” said Scrooge, “and his wild brother, Orson;\nthere they go! And what’s his name, who was put down in his\ndrawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you see him! And\nthe Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is\nupon his head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What business had\nhe to be married to the Princess!”\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the city, indeed.\n\n“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body\nand yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of\nhis head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came\nhome again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe,\nwhere have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was\ndreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes\nFriday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\nhe said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried\nagain.\n\n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket,\nand looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but\nit’s too late now.”\n\n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.\n\n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy\nsinging a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have\ngiven him something: that’s all.”\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so,\n“Let us see another Christmas!”\n\nScrooge’s former self grew larger at the words, and the room\nbecame a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows\ncracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked\nlaths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge\nknew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that\neverything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the\nother boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\n\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\nlooked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\nanxiously towards the door.\n\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\nin, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\naddressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”\n\n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the\nchild, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To\nbring you home, home, home!”\n\n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.\n\n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for\ngood and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he\nused to be, that home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one\ndear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him\nonce more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent\nme in a coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said\nthe child, opening her eyes, “and are never to come back here; but\nfirst, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the\nmerriest time in all the world.”\n\n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.\n\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but\nbeing too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.\nThen she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door;\nand he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\n\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s\nbox, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself,\nwho glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw\nhim into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then\nconveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering\nbest-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the\ncelestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\nHere he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of\ncuriously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to\nthe young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to\noffer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered\nthat he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had\ntasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by\nthis time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the\nschoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily\ndown the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow\nfrom off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n\n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,”\nsaid the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\n\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I\nwill not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\n\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I\nthink, children.”\n\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\n\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\n\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”\n\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\nand repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\nby the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again;\nbut it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\n\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\nknew it.\n\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”\n\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\nexcitement:\n\n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s\nFezziwig alive again!”\n\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\norgan of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\njovial voice:\n\n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”\n\nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\naccompanied by his fellow-’prentice.\n\n“Dick Wilkins, to be sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n“Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was\nDick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!”\n\n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work\nto-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the\nshutters up,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands,\n“before a man can say Jack Robinson!”\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it! They\ncharged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had\n’em up in their places—four, five, six—barred ’em\nand pinned ’em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before\nyou could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\n\n“Hilli-ho!” cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high\ndesk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s\nhave lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”\n\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have cleared away, or\ncouldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was\ndone in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed\nfrom public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the\nlamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was\nas snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire\nto see upon a winter’s night.\n\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came\nMrs Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss\nFezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose\nhearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the\nbusiness. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the\ncook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came\nthe boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough\nfrom his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door\nbut one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In\nthey all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some\ngracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all\ncame, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once;\nhands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up\nagain; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old\ntop couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting\noff again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a\nbottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old\nFezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well\ndone!” and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter,\nespecially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his\nreappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers\nyet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a\nshutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight,\nor perish.\n\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\nit him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” Then old\nFezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a\ngood stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair\nof partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would\ndance, and had no notion of walking.",

                "text": "**Chapter 3: Mr Fezziwig’s Ball**\n\nBut if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old\nFezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs Fezziwig.\nAs to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the\nterm. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll\nuse it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves.\nThey shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t\nhave predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next.\nAnd when old Fezziwig and Mrs Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;\nadvance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey,\ncorkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig\n“cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\n\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr and Mrs.\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and\nshaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out,\nwished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the\ntwo ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful\nvoices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under\na counter in the back-shop.\n\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\n\n“A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly\nfolks so full of gratitude.”\n\n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so,\nsaid,\n\n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal\nmoney: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this\npraise?”\n\n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark,\nand speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n“It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy\nor unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a\ntoil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight\nand insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up:\nwhat then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a\nfortune.”\n\nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.\n\n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.\n\n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.\n\n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.\n\n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to\nsay a word or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”\n\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n\n“My time grows short,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”\n\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\nthe growing tree would fall.\n\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a\nmourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the\nlight that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very\nlittle. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort\nyou in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause\nto grieve.”\n\n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.\n\n“A golden one.”\n\n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said.\n“There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is\nnothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of\nwealth!”\n\n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All\nyour other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of\nits sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by\none, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”\n\n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so\nmuch wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor\nand content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our\nworldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it\nwas made, you were another man.”\n\n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.\n\n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,”\nshe returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were\none in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and\nhow keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I\nhave thought of it, and can release you.”\n\n“Have I ever sought release?”\n\n“In words. No. Never.”\n\n“In what, then?”\n\n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere\nof life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love\nof any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,”\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell\nme, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”\n\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of\nhimself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”\n\n“I would gladly think otherwise if I could,” she answered,\n“Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I\nknow how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free\nto-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a\ndowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh\neverything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false\nenough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your\nrepentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With\na full heart, for the love of him you once were.”\n\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\n\n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you\nwill—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will\ndismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from\nwhich it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you\nhave chosen!”\n\nShe left him, and they parted.\n\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, “show me no more! Conduct me\nhome. Why do you delight to torture me?”\n\n“One shadow more!” exclaimed the Ghost.\n\n“No more!” cried Scrooge. “No more. I don’t wish\nto see it. Show me no more!”\n\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\nto observe what happened next.\n\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\nuntil he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her\ndaughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there\nwere more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind\ncould count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not\nforty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was\nconducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond\nbelief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and\ndaughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter,\nsoon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young\nbrigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them!\nThough I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn’t for the\nwealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it\ndown; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have plucked it\noff, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in\nsport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done it; I\nshould have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and\nnever come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to\nhave touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have\nopened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and\nnever raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which\nwould be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do\nconfess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have\nbeen man enough to know its value.\n\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately\nensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards\nit the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet\nthe father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys\nand presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught\nthat was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for\nladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels,\nhold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,\nand kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and\ndelight with which the development of every package was received! The\nterrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting\na doll’s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of\nhaving swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The\nimmense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude,\nand ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by\ndegrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by\none stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed,\nand so subsided.\n\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n\n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile,\n“I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”\n\n“Who was it?”\n\n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same\nbreath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr Scrooge.”\n\n“Mr Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not\nshut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him.\nHis partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat\nalone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”\n\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me\nfrom this place.”\n\n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,”\nsaid the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”\n\n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”\n\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a\nface, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces\nit had shown him, wrestled with it.\n\n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”\n\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost\nwith no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort\nof its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and\nbright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized\nthe extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its\nhead.\n\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\ncould not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken\nflood upon the ground.\n\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\nto bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",

                "text": "**Chapter 4: Scrooge Extinguishes the Firstof the Three\n                Spirits**\n\nAwaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough\nsnore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\nno occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One.\nHe felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time,\nfor the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second\nmessenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention.\nBut finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder\nwhich of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them\nevery one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a\nsharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit\non the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by\nsurprise, and made nervous.\n\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being\nacquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the\ntime-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by\nobserving that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to\nmanslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a\ntolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing\nfor Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you\nto believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange\nappearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have\nastonished him very much.\n\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means\nprepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and\nno shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five\nminutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\nAll this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze\nof ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen\nghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at;\nand was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an\ninteresting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the\nconsolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think—as\nyou or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in\nthe predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would\nunquestionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think\nthat the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the\nadjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.\nThis idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and\nshuffled in his slippers to the door.\n\nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called\nhim by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.\n\nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone\na surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with\nliving green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which,\nbright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,\nand ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been\nscattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as\nthat dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s\ntime, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone.\nHeaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese,\ngame, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths\nof sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot\nchestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense\ntwelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim\nwith their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a\njolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not\nunlike Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light\non Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.\n\n“Come in!” exclaimed the Ghost. “Come in! and know me\nbetter, man!”\n\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was\nnot the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit’s eyes\nwere clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n\n“I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,” said the Spirit.\n“Look upon me!”\n\nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or\nmantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the\nfigure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be\nwarded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the\nample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no\nother covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial\nface, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its\nunconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was\nan antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was\neaten up with rust.",

Have you had many brothers, Spirit?”\n\n“More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.\n\n“A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge submissively, “conduct me where\nyou will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson\nwhich is working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me\nprofit by it.”\n\n“Touch my robe!”\n\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\n\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,\nall vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the\nhour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,\nwhere (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk\nand not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement\nin front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence\nit was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the\nroad below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.\n\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,\ncontrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with\nthe dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed\nup in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows\nthat crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the\nthick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest\nstreets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,\nwhose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all\nthe chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were\nblazing away to their dear hearts’ content. There was nothing very\ncheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer\nsun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n\nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial\nand full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now\nand then exchanging a facetious snowball—better-natured missile\nfar than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right and\nnot less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were\nstill half open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory.\nThere were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like\nthe waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and\ntumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\nruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness\nof their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in\nwanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the\nhung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in\nblooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the\nshopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that\npeople’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were\npiles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance,\nancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep\nthrough withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy,\nsetting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\ncompactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching\nto be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold\nand silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though\nmembers of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there\nwas something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round\ntheir little world in slow and passionless excitement.\n\nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps\ntwo shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was\nnot alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound,\nor that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the\ncanisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that\nthe blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or\neven that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\nextremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other\nspices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten\nsugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently\nbilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the\nFrench plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated\nboxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress;\nbut the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\npromise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door,\ncrashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the\ncounter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of\nthe like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his\npeople were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they\nfastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for\ngeneral inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\n\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and\naway they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and\nwith their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores\nof bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people,\ncarrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The sight of these\npoor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood\nwith Scrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the\ncovers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from\nhis torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice\nwhen there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled\neach other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\nhumour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel\nupon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!\n\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was\na genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their\ncooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven;\nwhere the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\n\n“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?”\nasked Scrooge.\n\n“There is. My own.”\n\n“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked\nScrooge.\n\n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”\n\n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“Because it needs it most.”\n\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought,\n“I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us,\nshould desire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent\nenjoyment.”\n\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n\n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh\nday, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,”\nsaid Scrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”\n\n“I!” cried the Spirit.\n\n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said\nScrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”\n\n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.\n\n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at\nleast in that of your family,” said Scrooge.\n\n“There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the\nSpirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of\npassion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our\nname, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had\nnever lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not\nus.”\n\nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had\nbeen before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality\nof the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that\nnotwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any\nplace with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could\nhave done in any lofty hall.\n\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this\npower of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and\nhis sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s\nclerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to\nhis robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and\nstopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of\nhis torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week\nhimself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian\nname; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed\nhouse!\n\nThen up rose Mrs Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out but\npoorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and\nmake a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by\nBelinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while\nMaster Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\ngetting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private\nproperty, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his\nmouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to\nshow his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits,\nboy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s\nthey had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in\nluxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about\nthe table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not\nproud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the\nslow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let\nout and peeled.\n\n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs.\nCratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as\nlate last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?”\n\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she\nspoke.\n\n“Here’s Martha, mother!” cried the two young\nCratchits. “Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”\n\n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!”\nsaid Mrs Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl\nand bonnet for her with officious zeal.\n\n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied\nthe girl, “and had to clear away this morning, mother!”\n\n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs.\nCratchit. “Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm,\nLord bless ye!”\n\n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young\nCratchits, who were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”\n\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\nthree feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\nhim; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look\nseasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking\nround.\n\n“Not coming,” said Mrs Cratchit.\n\n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high\nspirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way from\nchurch, and had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”\n\nMartha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in\njoke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran\ninto his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore\nhim off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in\nthe copper.\n\n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs Cratchit, when\nshe had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to\nhis heart’s content.\n\n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he\ngets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest\nthings you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people\nsaw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be\npleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars\nwalk, and blind men see.”\n\nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled\nmore when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister\nto his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as\nif, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded\nsome hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and\nround and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two\nubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon\nreturned in high procession.\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse—and in truth it was something very like it in that house.\nMrs Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan)\nhissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\nMiss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates;\nBob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two\nyoung Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At\nlast the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a\nbreathless pause, as Mrs Cratchit, looking slowly all along the\ncarving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,\nand when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two\nyoung Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and\nfeebly cried Hurrah!\n\nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there\never was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and\ncheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by\napple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the\nwhole family; indeed, as Mrs Cratchit said with great delight\n(surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t\nate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\nCratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows!\nBut now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs Cratchit left\nthe room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the\npudding up and bring it in.\n\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard,\nand stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition\nat which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.\n\nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell\nlike a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and\na pastrycook’s next door to each other, with a laundress’s\nnext door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs Cratchit\nentered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like\na speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of\nhalf-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly\nstuck into the top.\n\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs Cratchit since\ntheir marriage. Mrs Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind,\nshe would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat\nheresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\nthing.\n\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\nshovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew\nround the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a\none; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of\nglass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\n\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\nproposed:\n\n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”\n\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\n\n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\n\nHe sat very close to his father’s side upon his little stool. Bob\nheld his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and\nwished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from\nhim.\n\n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\nbefore, “tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”\n\n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor\nchimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If\nthese shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”\n\n“No, no,” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he\nwill be spared.”\n\n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my\nrace,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then?\nIf he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus\npopulation.”\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you be in heart, not\nadamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the\nsurplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what\nmen shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more\nworthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s\nchild. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too\nmuch life among his hungry brothers in the dust!”\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his\neyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own\nname.\n\n“Mr Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr.\nScrooge, the Founder of the Feast!”\n\n“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs Cratchit,\nreddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of\nmy mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for\nit.”\n\n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”\n\n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on\nwhich one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling\nman as Mr Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than\nyou do, poor fellow!”\n\n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas\nDay.”\n\n“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,”\nsaid Mrs Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry\nChristmas and a happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very\nhappy, I have no doubt!”\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but\nhe didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being\na man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire\nfrom between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner’s,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n“was much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up\nhis collars so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you\nhad been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and\nround; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\nthe snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it\nvery well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit’s\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of\nguests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and\nfur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them\nenter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!\n\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to\nfriendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to\ngive them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting\ncompany, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its\ncapacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its\nbright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very\nlamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of\nlight, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out\nloudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that\nhe had any company but Christmas!\n\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a\nbleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast\nabout, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread\nitself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost\nthat held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse\nrank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye,\nand frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of\ndarkest night.\n\n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,”\nreturned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”\n\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced\ntowards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a\ncheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and\nwoman, with their children and their children’s children, and\nanother generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday\nattire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of\nthe wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song—it\nhad been a very old song when he was a boy—and from time to time\nthey all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices,\nthe old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped,\nhis vigour sank again.\n\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and\npassing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To\nScrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a\nfrightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the\nthundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the\ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore,\non which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there\nstood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base,\nand storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of\nthe water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\n\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that\nthrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of\nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough\ntable at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their\ncan of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged\nand scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might\nbe: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\n\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until,\nbeing far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a\nship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the\nbow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their\nseveral stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of\nsome bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\nto some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for\nat a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\n\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\nthe wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the\nlonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\nprofound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\nengaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\nScrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in\na bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”\n\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest\nin a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should like\nto know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll cultivate his\nacquaintance.\n\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\nis infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge’s\nnephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and\ntwisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s\nniece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled\nfriends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n\n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”\n\n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” cried\nScrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”\n\n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece,\nindignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They\nare always in earnest.\n\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made\nto be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots\nabout her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the\nsunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature’s head.\nAltogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but\nsatisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.\n\n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s\nnephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might\nbe. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing\nto say against him.”\n\n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s\nniece. “At least you always tell me so.”\n\n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew.\n“His wealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with\nit. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the\nsatisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going\nto benefit US with it.”\n\n“I have no patience with him,” observed Scrooge’s\nniece. Scrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies,\nexpressed the same opinion.\n\n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry\nfor him; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by\nhis ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to\ndislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us. What’s the\nconsequence? He don’t lose much of a dinner.”\n\n“Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,” interrupted\nScrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be\nallowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner;\nand, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by\nlamplight.\n\n“Well! I’m very glad to hear it,” said Scrooge’s\nnephew, “because I haven’t great faith in these young\nhousekeepers. What do you say, Topper?”\n\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s\nsisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had\nno right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s\nniece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the\none with the roses—blushed.\n\n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her\nhands. “He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a\nridiculous fellow!”\n\nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\nimpossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard\nto do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n\n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew,\n“that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not\nmaking merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\nmoments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter\ncompanions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy\nold office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance\nevery year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at\nChristmas till he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it—I\ndefy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after\nyear, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the\nvein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that’s\nsomething; and I think I shook him yesterday.”\n\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But\nbeing thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at,\nso that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment,\nand passed the bottle joyously.\n\nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew\nwhat they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:\nespecially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and\nnever swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over\nit. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and played among\nother tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to\nwhistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who\nfetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the\nGhost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\nthings that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more\nand more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years\nago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own\nhappiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton’s\nspade that buried Jacob Marley.\n\nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while\nthey played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and\nnever better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child\nhimself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of\ncourse there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I\nbelieve he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\nthing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the Ghost of\nChristmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in\nthe lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature.\nKnocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against\nthe piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\nthere went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn’t\ncatch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them\ndid), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize\nyou, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would\ninstantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She\noften cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not. But\nwhen at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings,\nand her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence\nthere was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his\npretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to\ntouch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\npressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her\nneck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it,\nwhen, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential\ntogether, behind the curtains.\n\nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party,\nbut was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug\ncorner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she\njoined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the\nletters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where,\nshe was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew,\nbeat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper\ncould have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young\nand old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting\nin the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no\nsound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud,\nand very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best\nWhitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than\nScrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\n\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon\nhim with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay\nuntil the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n\n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour,\nSpirit, only one!”\n\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had to\nthink of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering\nto their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of\nquestioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was\nthinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a\nsavage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked\nsometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn’t\nmade a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t live\nin a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse,\nor an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a\ncat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew\nburst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled,\nthat he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump\nsister, falling into a similar state, cried out:\n\n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”\n\n“What is it?” cried Fred.\n\n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”\n\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\nsome objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to\nhave been “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was\nsufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr Scrooge, supposing\nthey had ever had any tendency that way.\n\n“He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,” said Fred,\n“and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a\nglass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, ‘Uncle\nScrooge!’ ”\n\n“Well! Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.\n\n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever\nhe is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t take\nit from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”\n\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that\nhe would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked\nthem in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the\nwhole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\n\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but\nalways with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they\nwere cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by\nstruggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,\nand it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s\nevery refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made\nfast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and\ntaught Scrooge his precepts.\n\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts\nof this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into\nthe space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while\nScrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,\nclearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it,\nuntil they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at\nthe Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its\nhair was grey.\n\n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.\n\n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost.\n“It ends to-night.”\n\n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.\n\n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”\n\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\n\n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said\nScrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see\nsomething strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your\nskirts. Is it a foot or a claw?”\n\n“It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was\nthe Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched,\nabject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and\nclung upon the outside of its garment.\n\n“Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the\nGhost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.",

                "text": "**Chapter 6: Ignorance and Want**\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently,\napproached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for\nin the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter\ngloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched\nhand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?”\nsaid Scrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not\nhappened, but will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued.\n“Is that so, Spirit?”\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague\nuncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more\nthan any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me\ngood, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am\nprepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you\nnot speak to me?”\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning\nfast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who\nhurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and\nconversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled\nthoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had\nseen them often.\n\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\ntalk.\n\n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I\ndon’t know much about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”\n\n“When did he die?” inquired another.\n\n“Last night, I believe.”\n\n“Why, what was the matter with him?” asked a third, taking a\nvast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought\nhe’d never die.”\n\n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.\n\n“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced\ngentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that\nshook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\n\n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large chin,\nyawning again. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t\nleft it to me. That’s all I know.”\n\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n\n“I don’t mind going if a lunch is provided,” observed\nthe gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be\nfed, if I make one.”\n\nAnother laugh.\n\n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,”\nsaid the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I\nnever eat lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When\nI come to think of it, I’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his\nmost particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met.\nBye, bye!”\n\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\n\nThe Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie\nhere.\n\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing\nwell in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in\na business point of view.\n\n“How are you?” said one.\n\n“How are you?” returned the other.\n\n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own\nat last, hey?”\n\n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I\nsuppose?”\n\n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”\n\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\nparting.\n\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\nPast, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think\nof any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply\nthem. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\nword he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\n\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man\nstood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\nthe multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little\nsurprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\nin this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from\nthe turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that\nthe Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and\nfeel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops\nand houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\ncharcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\nseventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air\nwithout, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a\nline; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\n\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\nthe sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each\nother. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man\nwith the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n“Let the charwoman alone to be the first!” cried she who had\nentered first. “Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let\nthe undertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe,\nhere’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without\nmeaning it!”\n\n“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old\nJoe, removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You\nwere made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t\nstrangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks!\nThere an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own\nhinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones\nhere, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re\nwell matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\nlamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth\nagain.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs Dilber?” said the woman.\n“Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He\nalways did.”\n\n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No\nman more so.”\n\n“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman;\nwho’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s\ncoats, I suppose?”\n\n“No, indeed!” said Mrs Dilber and the man together. “We\nshould hope not.”\n\n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s\nenough. Who’s the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\nNot a dead man, I suppose.”\n\n“No, indeed,” said Mrs Dilber, laughing.\n\n“If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead, a wicked old\nscrew,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in\nhis lifetime? If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after\nhim when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last\nthere, alone by himself.”\n\n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs.\nDilber. “It’s a judgment on him.”\n\n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the\nwoman; “and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I\ncould have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe,\nand let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid\nto be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that\nwe were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no\nsin. Open the bundle, Joe.”\n\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in\nfaded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It\nwas not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of\nsleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were\nseverally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was\ndisposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total\nwhen he found there was nothing more to come.\n\n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t\ngive another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s\nnext?”\n\nMrs Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two\nold-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots.\nHer account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\n\n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine,\nand that’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s\nyour account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open\nquestion, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off\nhalf-a-crown.”\n\n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.\n\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,\nand having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy\nroll of some dark stuff.\n\n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on\nher crossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”\n\n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and\nall, with him lying there?” said Joe.\n\n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”\n\n“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and\nyou’ll certainly do it.”\n\n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in\nit by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise\nyou, Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that\noil upon the blankets, now.”\n\n“His blankets?” asked Joe.\n\n“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman.\n“He isn’t likely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”\n\n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said\nold Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\n\n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman.\n“I an’t so fond of his company that I’d loiter about\nhim for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till\nyour eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare\nplace. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have\nwasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”\n\n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.\n\n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the\nwoman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took\nit off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it\nisn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to\nthe body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.”\n\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about\ntheir spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp,\nhe viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have\nbeen greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse\nitself.\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a\nflannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the\nground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one\naway from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha,\nha!”\n\n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot.\n“I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My\nlife tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”\n\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost\ntouched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged\nsheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,\nannounced itself in awful language.\n\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,\nthough Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,\nanxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the\nouter air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,\nunwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\n\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the\nhead. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of\nit, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have\ndisclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do,\nand longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to\ndismiss the spectre at his side.\n\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress\nit with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy\ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not\nturn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is\nnot that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not\nthat the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was\nopen, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the\npulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds\nspringing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\n\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he\nheard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be\nraised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice,\nhard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!\n\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to\nsay that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one\nkind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and\nthere was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they\nwanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and\ndisturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n\n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In\nleaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”\n\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\n\n“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do\nit, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”\n\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\n\n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by\nthis man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show\nthat person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!”\n\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing;\nand withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her\nchildren were.\n\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked\nup and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the\nwindow; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her\nneedle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.\n\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door,\nand met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though\nhe was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of\nserious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to\nrepress.\n\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire;\nand when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a\nlong silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\n\n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help\nhim.\n\n“Bad,” he answered.\n\n“We are quite ruined?”\n\n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”\n\n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is!\nNothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.”\n\n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”\n\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was\nthankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands.\nShe prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was\nthe emotion of her heart.\n\n“What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said\nto me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week’s delay; and what\nI thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite\ntrue. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”\n\n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”\n\n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with\nthe money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed\nto find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night\nwith light hearts, Caroline!”\n\nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children’s\nfaces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little\nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s\ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the\nevent, was one of pleasure.\n\n“Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,” said\nScrooge; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now,\nwill be for ever present to me.”\n\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet;\nand as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself,\nbut nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s\nhouse; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the\nchildren seated round the fire.\n\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues\nin one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they\nwere very quiet!\n\n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of\nthem.’ ”\n\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy\nmust have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why\ndid he not go on?\n\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her\nface.\n\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\n\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!\n\n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s\nwife. “It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t\nshow weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must\nbe near his time.”\n\n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up his book.\n“But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few\nlast evenings, mother.”\n\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful\nvoice, that only faltered once:\n\n“I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny\nTim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”\n\n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”\n\n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.\n\n“But he was very light to carry,” she resumed, intent upon\nher work, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no\ntrouble. And there is your father at the door!”\n\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he\nhad need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on\nthe hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two\nyoung Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek,\nagainst his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father.\nDon’t be grieved!”\n\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\nHe looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed\nof Mrs Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,\nhe said.\n\n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.\n\n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have\ngone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But\nyou’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a\nSunday. My little, little child!” cried Bob. “My little\nchild!”\n\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have\nhelped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than\nthey were.\n\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was\nlighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close\nbeside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there,\nlately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and\ncomposed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy.\n\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working\nstill. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr Scrooge’s\nnephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the\nstreet that day, and seeing that he looked a little—“just a\nlittle down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened to\ndistress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the\npleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am\nheartily sorry for it, Mr Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily\nsorry for your good wife.’ By the bye, how he ever knew that,\nI don’t know.”\n\n“Knew what, my dear?”\n\n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.\n\n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.\n\n“Very well observed, my boy!” cried Bob. “I hope they\ndo. ‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If\nI can be of service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his\ncard, ‘that’s where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it\nwasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he might\nbe able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite\ndelightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt\nwith us.”\n\n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs Cratchit.\n\n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if\nyou saw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark\nwhat I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”\n\n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs Cratchit.\n\n“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter will be\nkeeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.”\n\n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.\n\n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of\nthese days; though there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But\nhowever and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none\nof us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting\nthat there was among us?”\n\n“Never, father!” cried they all.\n\n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when\nwe recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little,\nlittle child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget\npoor Tiny Tim in doing it.”\n\n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.\n\n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”\n\nMrs Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young\nCratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny\nTim, thy childish essence was from God!\n\n“Spectre,” said Scrooge, “something informs me that\nour parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me\nwhat man that was whom we saw lying dead?”\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before—though\nat a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these\nlatter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts\nof business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not\nstay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,\nuntil besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n\n“This court,” said Scrooge, “through which we hurry\nnow, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of\ntime. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”\n\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\n\n“The house is yonder,” Scrooge exclaimed. “Why do you\npoint away?”\n\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\n\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an\noffice still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the\nfigure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.\n\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone,\naccompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round\nbefore entering.\n\nA churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to\nlearn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by\nhouses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation’s\ndeath, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted\nappetite. A worthy place!\n\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced\ntowards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he\ndreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\n\n“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,”\nsaid Scrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of\nthe things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be,\nonly?”\n\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\n\n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if\npersevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the\ncourses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what\nyou show me!”\n\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\n\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the\nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.",

                "text": "**Chapter 7: The Last of the Spirits**\n\n“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon\nhis knees.\n\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\n\n“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!”\n\nThe finger still was there.\n\n“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear\nme! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but\nfor this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”\n\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\n\n“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell\nbefore it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure\nme that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered\nlife!”\n\nThe kind hand trembled.\n\n“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the\nyear. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits\nof all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons\nthat they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this\nstone!”\n\nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but\nhe was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger\nyet, repulsed him.\n\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw\nan alteration in the Phantom’s hood and dress. It shrunk,\ncollapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\n\nYes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was\nhis own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before\nhim was his own, to make amends in!\n\n“I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!”\nScrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. “The Spirits of all\nThree shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmas\nTime be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!”\n\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his\nbroken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing\nviolently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with\ntears.\n\n“They are not torn down,” cried Scrooge, folding one of his\nbed-curtains in his arms, “they are not torn down, rings and all.\nThey are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would\nhave been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!”\n\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside\nout, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making\nthem parties to every kind of extravagance.\n\n“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and\ncrying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with\nhis stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an\nangel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A\nmerry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo\nhere! Whoop! Hallo!”\n\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there:\nperfectly winded.\n\n“There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in!” cried\nScrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s\nthe door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the\ncorner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the\nwindow where I saw the wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s\nall true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”\n\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was\na splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long\nline of brilliant laughs!\n\n“I don’t know what day of the month it is!” said\nScrooge. “I don’t know how long I’ve been among the\nSpirits. I don’t know anything. I’m quite a baby. Never\nmind. I don’t care. I’d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!\nHallo here!”\n\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the\nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong,\nbell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!\n\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no\nmist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood\nto dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry\nbells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!\n\n“What’s to-day!” cried Scrooge, calling downward to a\nboy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\n\n“Eh?” returned the boy, with all\nhis might of wonder.\n\n“What’s to-day, my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.\n\n“To-day!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas\nDay.”\n\n“It’s Christmas Day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I\nhaven’t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They\ncan do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can.\nHallo, my fine fellow!”\n\n“Hallo!” returned the boy.\n\n“Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at\nthe corner?” Scrooge inquired.\n\n“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.\n\n“An intelligent boy!” said Scrooge. “A remarkable boy!\nDo you know whether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging\nup there?—Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?”\n\n“What, the one as big as me?” returned the boy.\n\n“What a delightful boy!” said Scrooge. “It’s a\npleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!”\n\n“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy.\n\n“Is it?” said Scrooge. “Go and buy it.”\n\n“Walk-er!” exclaimed the boy.\n\n“No, no,” said Scrooge, “I am in earnest. Go and buy\nit, and tell ’em to bring it here, that I may give them the\ndirection where to take it. Come back with the man, and I’ll give\nyou a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I’ll\ngive you half-a-crown!”\n\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger\nwho could have got a shot off half so fast.\n\n“I’ll send it to Bob Cratchit’s!” whispered\nScrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. “He sha’n’t\nknow who sends it. It’s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller\nnever made such a joke as sending it to Bob’s will be!”\n\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write\nit he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready\nfor the coming of the poulterer’s man. As he stood there, waiting\nhis arrival, the knocker caught his eye.\n\n“I shall love it, as long as I live!” cried Scrooge, patting\nit with his hand. “I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an\nhonest expression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s\nthe Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!”\n\nIt was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that\nbird. He would have snapped ’em short off in a minute, like sticks\nof sealing-wax.\n\n“Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,”\nsaid Scrooge. “You must have a cab.”\n\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid\nfor the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\nchuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by\nthe chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\nchuckled till he cried.\n\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;\nand shaving requires attention, even when you don’t dance while\nyou are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have\nput a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\n\nHe dressed himself “all in his best,” and at last got out\ninto the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had\nseen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his\nhands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He\nlooked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four\ngood-humoured fellows said, “Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas\nto you!” And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe\nsounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly\ngentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and\nsaid, “Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe?” It sent a\npang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon\nhim when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he\ntook it.\n\n“My dear sir,” said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking\nthe old gentleman by both his hands. “How do you do? I hope you\nsucceeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you,\nsir!”\n\n“Mr Scrooge?”\n\n“Yes,” said Scrooge. “That is my name, and I fear it\nmay not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you\nhave the goodness”—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.\n\n“Lord bless me!” cried the gentleman, as if his breath were\ntaken away. “My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?”\n\n“If you please,” said Scrooge. “Not a farthing less. A\ngreat many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do\nme that favour?”\n\n“My dear sir,” said the other, shaking hands with him.\n“I don’t know what to say to such munifi—”\n\n“Don’t say anything, please,” retorted Scrooge.\n“Come and see me. Will you come and see me?”\n\n“I will!” cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant\nto do it.\n\n“Thank’ee,” said Scrooge. “I am much obliged to\nyou. I thank you fifty times. Bless you!”\n\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\nhurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned\nbeggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the\nwindows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had\nnever dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so\nmuch happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew’s\nhouse.\n\nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and\nknock. But he made a dash, and did it:\n\n“Is your master at home, my dear?” said Scrooge to the girl.\nNice girl! Very.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Where is he, my love?” said Scrooge.\n\n“He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll\nshow you up-stairs, if you please.”\n\n“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Scrooge, with his hand\nalready on the dining-room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”\n\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\nthat everything is right.\n\n“Fred!” said Scrooge.\n\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had\nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the\nfootstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.\n\n“Why bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who’s that?”\n\n“It’s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you\nlet me in, Fred?”\n\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at\nhome in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just\nthe same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump sister\nwhen she came. So did every one when they came. Wonderful\nparty, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\n\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\nwas the thing he had set his heart upon.\n\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\nTank.\n\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on\nhis stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to\novertake nine o’clock.\n\n“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near\nas he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this\ntime of day?”\n\n“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind\nmy time.”\n\n“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are.\nStep this way, sir, if you please.”\n\n“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing\nfrom the Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather\nmerry yesterday, sir.”\n\n“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge,\n“I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And\ntherefore,” he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob\nsuch a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again;\n“and therefore I am about to raise your salary!”\n\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n\n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness\nthat could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A\nmerrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many\na year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your\nstruggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon,\nover a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy\nanother coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!”",
