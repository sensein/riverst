## Do you need/want to...

- build interactive user-avatar experiences (speech-based, with video/multimodal support)?
- collect high-quality conversational data for research or industry projects?
- automatically analyze conversations for behavioral, linguistic, or engagement metrics?

## What is Riverst?

Riverst is a platform for building, running, and analyzing interactive user-avatar conversations. It enables you to:

- Create engaging, speech-driven (and optionally multimodal) avatar interactions.
- Use these interactions for real-time applications, data collection, or research studies.
- Automatically process and analyze collected conversations with built-in pipelines (leveraging [senselab](https://github.com/sensein/senselab)) for behavioral and speech analysis.

---

## How it works

1. **User interacts with an avatar** (primarily via speech, with optional video/multimodal input).
2. **Conversations are recorded and stored** for later review or analysis.
3. **Automated pipelines** process the data, extracting features and generating insights (e.g., speech metrics, behavioral markers).
4. **Results can be used** for research, product feedback, or to power adaptive experiences.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── server/              # Bot server implementation (FastAPI)
│   ├── main.py          # Server entrypoint
│   └── requirements.txt
└── flow-builder/        # Conversational flow builder
└── client/              # Client implementations
    └── react/           # React web client
        └── index.html   # Client main page

```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 16+ (for React client)
- API keys for 3rd party services (see .env.example files in both client and server)
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support (e.g., Chrome 134+)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sensein/riverst.git
cd riverst
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `src/server/` and `src/client/react/`
- Fill in required API keys and configuration

### 3. Run with Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Or run manually

- **Start the server:**
  ```bash
  cd src/server
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python main.py
  ```
- **Start the client:**
  ```bash
  cd src/client/react
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

> **Note:** The server must be running before starting the client.
> **Note 2:** For AWS EC2 deployment instructions, see [here](notes/first_steps_to_deploy.md).
